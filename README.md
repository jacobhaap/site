# Personal Website

This is the source code of my personal website, [jacobhaap.com](jacobhaap.com). The site is built with React using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

All pages are saved in Markdown, and rendered by a `MarkdownRender.js` module called by `App.js`.

## Available Scripts

`npm start` to run the app in development mode.

`npm test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` directory.
