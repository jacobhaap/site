*Greetings fellow humans! I'm Jacob, a human who does stuff.*

***

Based in [Berlin, Germany](https://earth.google.com/web/search/Berlin/), and raised in the [United States](https://earth.google.com/web/search/Cincinnati,+OH,+USA/), I am a Software Architect specializing in Web3 & Blockchain Technologies, working as the Founder & CEO of early-stage startup [Anomaly Science](https://anomsci.com/), developing a tokenized solution for software licensing, and web3 developer tools. I love travel and commercial aviation, frequently traveling around Europe, with regular visits to North America. I enjoy sandbox games, with Minecraft and No Man’s Sky being my favorites, and I really love Indie music, with Arcade Fire being my favorite band by far.
