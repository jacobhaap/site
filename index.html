        <p>
          Hej! I’m Jacob, an 18-year-old American expat living in Berlin! I am the CEO for my startup, <a href="https://anomaly-science.com/" target="_blank">Anomaly Science</a>, a company building a platform for software developers offering intellectual property management and the formation & management of international teams, all through the use of the blockchain. This gives developers more ownership in what they are doing and greater self-determination, building a better future for software developers. I see it as my purpose in life to better the way humanity is. I wish to the best of my ability to assist in the development of new technologies that help increase human lifespan, change the way we think, and improve quality of life. When I think about the things that are most important to me in life, one of them is how I will be remembered. I want to leave my mark on the world, and be remembered for the innovations I made and the people I impacted.

          <b>Jacob Standard Time (JCST) // UTC<span id="clockboxOffset">0</span></b>
          <p>Jacob Standard Time is a system of timekeeping I created, that is UTC+/- whatever I feel like. This system was developed so that I could feel better about maintaining a bad sleep schedule, by adjusting the time zone so I could always go to bed at a reasonable time. The time changes are highly unpredictable and individuals are strongly discouraged from using it.</p>
